# Reserved Characters in Programming

This document outlines the reserved characters commonly used in programming languages, particularly in languages like C#, Java, and C++. Each character has specific roles in syntax, operations, or declarations.

## Braces `{ }`
- Define the scope or block of code.
- Used in methods, loops, conditionals, and class definitions.

## Parentheses `( )`
- Enclose method calls and declarations.
- Control the order of operations in expressions.
- Surround conditions in control structures (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`).

## Square Brackets `[ ]`
- Declare and access array elements.
- Used in attribute declarations.

## Semicolon `;`
- Terminates statements.

## Colon `:`
- Used in ternary operator expressions.
- Appears in `case` statements within `switch` blocks.
- Denotes base classes or interfaces in class declarations.

## Comma `,`
- Separates items in lists, such as method parameters or variable declarations.

## Period `.`
- Accesses members of a class or namespace (e.g., methods, properties).

## Question Mark `?`
- Indicates nullable type declarations.
- Used in null-conditional operators and ternary operator expressions.

## Plus `+`
- Performs arithmetic addition.
- Concatenates strings.
- Denotes unary plus or overloaded operators.

## Minus `-`
- Performs arithmetic subtraction.
- Indicates negative numbers.
- Defines overloaded operators.

## Asterisk `*`
- Performs arithmetic multiplication.
- Denotes pointer types in unsafe code.
- Defines overloaded operators.

## Slash `/`
- Performs arithmetic division.
- Initiates comments (`//` for single-line, `/* */` for multi-line).

## Percentage `%`
- Represents the modulus operator.

## Ampersand `&`
- Acts as the address-of operator in unsafe code.
- Performs logical AND and bitwise AND operations.
- Indicates reference parameters in method signatures.

## Pipe `|`
- Performs logical OR and bitwise OR operations.

## Caret `^`
- Performs bitwise XOR operations.

## Exclamation Mark `!`
- Denotes logical negation.

## Tilde `~`
- Performs bitwise NOT operations.
- Defines destructor methods in classes.

## Angle Brackets `< >`
- Define generic types and methods.
- Used for less-than and greater-than comparisons.

## Equals `=`
- Assigns values.
- Tests equality when used as `==`.
- Used in lambda expressions (`=>`).

## At Sign `@`
- Prefixes verbatim string literals, ignoring escape sequences.
- Allows keywords to be used as identifiers.

## Dollar Sign `$`
- Denotes string interpolation for embedding variables in string literals.

## Backslash `\`
- Acts as an escape character in string literals (e.g., `\n` for new line, `\t` for tab).

## Hash `#`
- Used in preprocessor directives (e.g., `#define`, `#if`, `#else`, `#endif`, `#region`, `#endregion`).
